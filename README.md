# WSO2 API Manager with Identity Server as Key Manager 

5. WSO2 no longer provides an on-premise Analytics solution. In order to connect WSO2 API Manager to [Choreo Analytics](https://analytics.choreo.dev/), obtain an `on-prem-key` by following the steps in the [documentation](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/4.6.0/observe/api-manager-analytics/configure-analytics/register-for-analytics/).

6. Update the analytics configurations in [deployment.toml](./conf/apim/repository/conf/deployment.toml) with the `on-prem key` obtained.

    ```toml
    [apim.analytics]
    enable = true
    config_endpoint = "https://analytics-event-auth.choreo.dev/auth/v1"
    auth_token = "on-prem-key"
    ```

7. Execute following Docker Compose command to start the deployment.

   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
